- 👋 Hi, I’m Josue Vergara Alarcón

- 👀 I’m interested in how we can use technology for public management, urban planning, territorial organization
and innovation of public transportation systems to make them more efficient, environmentally friendly and provide
better control of the operation to reduce costs, reduce travel times and generally improve the user experience.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning urban planning and design at the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM).
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on technological projects with applications in the territory, such as drones, 
geographical information systems, etc.

- 📫 How to reach me; send me an email to jva.urbanismo@gmail.com and I will get back to you as soon as possible.
